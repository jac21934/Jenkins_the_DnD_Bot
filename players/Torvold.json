He became a scout in the Omlarandin Blades mercanary band. They took a job guarding a fortress for the Warlock Lord Kalnoth, on a mountain in the North Wall. But the band was actually there be human sacrifices for Kalnoth's unholy experiments. The whole band was sacrificed in a massive magical explosion except for Torvold (and possibly unknown others), who was just returning from a scouting mission. The explosion knocked him out, and who knows what other side effects it may have imparted to him? He barely escaped the fortress after discovering the truth, and made his way back to Ormpur to find new work. He's been working odd jobs ever since, scraping together meager money to send back to his village."],"_stradd":0,"_dexadd":0,"_conadd":0,"_intadd":0,"_wisadd":0,"_chaadd":0,"_profbonusadd":0,"_acadd":0,"_initadd":0,"_spdadd":0,"_peradd":0,"_hpadd":0,"_strsavadd":0,"_athadd":0,"_dexsavadd":0,"_acroadd":0,"_sleightadd":0,"_stealthadd":0,"_consavadd":0,"_intsavadd":0,"_arcanaadd":0,"_historyadd":0,"_investadd":0,"_natureadd":0,"_religionadd":0,"_wissavadd":0,"_animaladd":0,"_insightadd":0,"_medicineadd":0,"_survadd":0,"_chasavadd":0,"_deceptadd":0,"_intimadd":0,"_performadd":0,"_persadd":0}
